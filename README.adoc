A password safe written in go using and implementing the http://pwsafe.org/[password safe] version 3 database.

The pwsafe package is a library for reading/writing to Password Safe v3 databases.
The pwa directory contains a [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) frontend for the pwsafe package that can be installed locally as a Progressive Web App (PWA).
The pwa works great both on mobile or desktop and when installed is fully available offline.
